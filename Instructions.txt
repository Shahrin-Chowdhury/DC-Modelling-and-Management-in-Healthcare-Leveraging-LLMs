
1. The python code written based on considering the 18 factors and subfactors and their different categorization.

2. The Python code 'Factors_with_text.py'is used for generating synthetic data set 'descriptive_patient_dataset.csv'.

3. Three different LLMs: LLaMA32, DeepSeek-R13, and OpenChat4 have applied on the dataset considering 
   three scenarios (S1,S2, and S3) to identify the accuracy for consent fatigue prediction

4. Five ML model: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
   Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been applid on the dataset and calculate
   mean accuracy (MA) and standard deviation (Std).

5. MATLAB has been used to simulate the proposed model. MATLAB applied on the same dataset and 2 visuals appeared as output.
   The histogram graph presented overall distributionof fatigue probabilities (Pfatigue) across patients and the Spotted graph
   presents a positive correlation between cumulative burden and fatigue probability.
